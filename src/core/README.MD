# Core Module Overview

The `core` directory forms the backbone of our application, encapsulating essential services, utilities, and foundational components that provide the underlying logic and infrastructure support across the application. This module is designed to ensure high cohesion and low coupling, promoting reusability and maintainability of the core functionalities.

## Structure

The `core` module is organized into several subdirectories, each representing a critical aspect of the application's core functionality:

- `/messaging`: Contains the messaging service, responsible for handling all aspects of message processing, including creation, validation, and delivery.
