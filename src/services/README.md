# Services Directory

The `services` directory is a central part of our application, housing the business logic and data access layers that interact with various external APIs, databases, and other services. This structure allows for a clean separation of concerns and enhances the modularity and maintainability of the application.

## Structure

The directory is organized into subdirectories, each representing a distinct service or a group of related services. Key subdirectories include:

- `/firebase`: Contains services that interact with Firebase, including Firestore database operations.
